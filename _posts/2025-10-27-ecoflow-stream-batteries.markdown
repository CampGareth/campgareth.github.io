# Background

## History of Solar At Home

Over the past few decades people have been getting more environmentally conscious, and electricity prices have been going up. This has led many people to install solar panels at home to supply some of their electricity from green sources and reduce their bills. 

Historically this has only been possible for owners of traditional homes with £10-15k cash to spare. The panels used to be expensive as did scaffolding and the labour costs of getting a couple of trained electricians to work on your roof for a couple of days. Renters were out of luck as they didn't own the roof space or might not have roof space at all in the case of apartment dwellers. Landlords were unlikely to invest thousands of pounds to reduce their tenant's electricity bills without a direct return on investment.

Recently things have been changing. You can now get a single 500 Watt peak (Wp) solar panel for about £60-80 making a normal 4kWp array around £480-640. Labour costs are now the biggest line item in a traditional installation. Meanwhile legislation in countries like Germany has changed to legalise installing panels in easy to access locations such as balconies. Germany has also legalised feeding small amounts of power back into the grid, up to 800W if I remember correctly.

These changes have enabled "Balcony Solar" systems which are particularly useful for renters as they can be installed cheaply, transported during house moves, and provide a significant reduction on electricity bills. Ecoflow developed the first generation PowerStream Microinverter to cater to this market. It had two 400W solar inputs and could output 800W to the mains supply in your home.

One aspect of solar panels that isn't great is the sun shines when you don't need it. Usually peak output is in the midday to 4pm range when people may not be at home. You can schedule appliances to run in this period but to make the most of the energy you need to store it in a battery and use it when you're at home or when electricity is most expensive, e.g. the 4-7pm demand peak as people cook dinner. Ecoflow's first generation PowerStream had a battery connector to allow you to store excess power in one of their portable battery products, however for the second generation they removed that connector and made the PowerStream a pure microinverter. They also released the Ecoflow Stream lineup.

## What is an Ecoflow Stream Battery?

It's a grid-tie hybrid solar inverter with an integrated 1.9kWh battery. There are a few different models but the top spec one can receive 2kW of input power from 4 x 500W solar panel inputs, charge the internal battery from solar or mains, and output 1200W (800W in the UK) back to the grid from the battery or solar inputs. It has wifi and bluetooth connectivity with an app to manage the device. It can pair with other Stream batteries to function as a larger battery, transferring power between units using your home wiring. There are integrated plugs on each unit with a 1200W power limit (rising to 2300W if two units are combined) plus power monitoring and remote control. It can be made aware of your electricity tariff to charge from the mains when it's cheap and cover your consumption when it's expensive. It can also pair with a whole-home power monitor or smart plugs (more on that later) to cover your whole home power consumption.

Phew. That's a lot of features, but you're all caught up now.

# Review

## The Setup

I've bought 3 Stream batteries, one Ultra, one Max and one AC Pro. I've also bought 3 Ecoflow x Shelly Smart Plugs (UK). The Ultra has every feature including 4 solar inputs and 2 mains sockets on the rear. The Max has 2 solar inputs and 1 socket, while the AC Pro has no solar inputs and 2 sockets. There's also an AC (non-Pro) which has no inputs or sockets, it's just a grid tie battery, which I haven't bought. I haven't bought a whole-home power monitor as I rent my home and can't get to the wires running to my CU to attach the current-sensing clamps.

The Ultra is in my living room with 2 of the solar inputs in use. Each input has 2 x 450W bifacial solar panels connected in parallel and mounted vertically on a south-facing fence for a total of 1800Wp, though the highest the inputs support is 1000W. The Ultra powers my TV, games consoles etc and an electric heater. The AC Pro is in my office powering my desk and a 200W window heat pump. The Max is in my bedroom with its 2 solar inputs each connected to a 50W flexible solar panel stuffed into a skylight for 100Wp. The Max powers a 500W electric heater with a timer.

# WIP

## How well does each battery work?

Very well! 

## How well do they work combined?

Pretty well, some quirks. How does it decide which battery to charge? Maximum 1200W output only to connected devices, 800W into grid maximum from all batteries combined. Efficiency? 

## What about the app functions?

Broadly good, lots of information but minimal control over batteries. Built to be hands-off. Talk about delays in scheduling.  

## What about the AI functions?

Talk about what it does, uncertainty over higher AI tiers, Octopus Agile combining 30 minute slots into 60 minute average slots.

## Pairing with smart plugs?

Doesn't work properly today. Generally bad experience for an officially supported and advertised combination

## Competition

Competition's a lot cheaper per kWh, but less plug and play.

## Recommend them?

Yes! Maybe not at full price, try ebay refurbished units.
